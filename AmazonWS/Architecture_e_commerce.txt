Considerations:
1) Multiple Languages
2) Multiple Currencies				-- have to accept multiple currencies   -- quote in  US dollors and convert them during sale
3) Multiple Cultures
4) Multiple tax laws
5) Multiple shipping/custom rules


Multiple type payments --- Credit Cards,debit cards etc..  -- Credit-card transactions are fairly easy to process electronically and have the advantage that credit-card processors will do the currency exchange for you automatically.
